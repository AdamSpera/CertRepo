        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>Hello! My names Adam Spera, I created and publish to OpenCache! Here's a little bit about me:</p>
        <li>I'm a student at Arcadia University with an interest in Web Development and Computer Networking.</li>
        <li>I've always had a passion for creating platforms that help people, first with LaundryLott, and now OpenCache.</li>
        <li>I have had the privilege to work with many great organizations, most notably listed below:</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 60px; list-style-type: circle;">I worked as a Network Administrator Intern at Arcadia University during Summer 2022</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 60px; list-style-type: circle;">I worked as a TCE Network Recreate Engineer Co-op in the CX Labs at Cisco during Spring 2023</li>
        <li>During my time in university and at work, I have earned a number of certifications, and hope to share that knowledge through OpenCache!</li>
        <p>For more about me, see the links below! Happy learning!</p>
        <p>Always remember, the RIB rebuilds the FIB...</p>
