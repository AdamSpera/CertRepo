## Overview

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) describes the cloud as a model that provides easy, omnipresent, on-demand network access to a shared collection of adjustable computing resources. These resources, such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services, can be quickly set up and taken down with little management effort or interaction with the service provider.

The NIST identifies cloud computing with these essential characteristics:

1. On-demand self-service
2. Broad network access
3. Resource pooling
4. Rapid elasticity
5. Measured service

## Service Models

The NIST defines three cloud service models:

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

- Software as a service (SaaS)

- Platform as a service (PaaS)

The NIST defines three basic cost models that are typically used:

- Fixed cost

- Allocation-based cost

- Utilization-based cost

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

VMs, OS, and Application

Admin logs into the web console, to create a VM, and then installs the OS and application.

I want two new VMs, one for a web server and one for a database server. I will install the OS and application on each VM.

Customer does the following:

- Application

- Data

- Runtime

- Middleware

- Operating System

Vender covers the following:

- Virtualization

- Servers

- Storage

- Networking

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Similar to Amazon Elastic2, all the end user does is og onto teh web console and create a new application. The application is automatically deployed to a VM. The user does not manage the VM, just deploys code.

Customer does the following:

- Application

- Data

Vender covers the following:

- Runtime

- Middleware

- Operating System

- Virtualization

- Servers

- Storage

- Networking

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Similar to Gmail, the end user logs into the web console and uses the application. The user does not manage the VM or the application.

Vender covers the following:

- Application

- Data

- Runtime

- Middleware

- Operating System

- Virtualization

- Servers

- Storage

- Networking

## Cloud Deployment Models

The NIST defines four cloud deployment models:

**Private Cloud**

- Used by a single organization
- No public access
- Completely dedicated to the organization

Main advantage: Control over corporate data, security, and performance

**Public Cloud**

- Used by the general public
- Deployed by provider

**Hybrid Cloud**

- Combination of public and private cloud
- Allows for a mix of mostly private and a little public

**Community Cloud**

- Used by a group of organizations
- Built and managed by the organizations
